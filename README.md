# JobPortal
I have created a UI for the Job Portal. 
Frontend: Netx.js with Tailwind.css
Authentication: JWT
I have created the portal for both admin and regular user. 
When the admin logsin, he can see the job post lists and he can also posts the jobs. 
If a user applied for that particular job, that information can also be seen in the admin page. 
Now when a regualr user logsin, he can se the list of jobs that he can apply. When they click on apply here button then they can see the form to fill for that particular job. 
After filling the application when user clicks on submit button then that application will be sent to admin page. 

# If i get two more days, i can complete the full-stack for this with all the necessary requirements. 
for now, i have hard-coded the login page but later i can implement it dynamically using the bcrypt libraries.
